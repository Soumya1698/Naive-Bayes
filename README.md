 Naive Bayes 
-----------------
When we come across large data sets, we can bring this algorithm to action. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods. This algorithm is mostly used in text classification/ Spam Filtering/ Sentiment Analysis/Recommendation System and with problems having multiple classes.
 
:radio_button: popular Naive Bayes classifiers are:
-------------------------
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Feature vectors represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial distribution. This is the event model typically used for document classification.

Bernoulli Naive Bayes: In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent booleans (binary variables) describing inputs.

When we come across large data sets, we can bring this algorithm to action. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods. This algorithm is mostly used in text classification/ Spam Filtering/ Sentiment Analysis/Recommendation System and with problems having multiple classes. I made this infographic for a clear understanding of the algorithm. 

Popular Naive Bayes classifiers are:

1. Gaussian: It is used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.</br>

2. Multinomial Naive Bayes: Feature vectors represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial distribution. This is the event model typically used for document classification.

</br>3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes: In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent booleans (binary variables) describing inputs.
